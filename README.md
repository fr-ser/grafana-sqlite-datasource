This is a Grafana backend plugin to allow using an SQLite database as a data source.
The SQLite database needs to be accessible to the filesystem of the device where Grafana itself
is running.

## Plugin Installation

The recommended way to install the plugin for most users is to use the grafana CLI:

1. Run this command: `grafana-cli plugins install frser-sqlite-datasource`
2. Restart the Grafana server.
3. To make sure the plugin was installed, check the list of installed data sources. Click the
   Plugins item in the main menu. Both core data sources and installed data sources will appear.

For other installation options (e.g. to install versions not yet released in the Grafana registry but in Github) see
[./docs/installation.md](https://github.com/fr-ser/grafana-sqlite-datasource/blob/main/docs/installation.md).

## Security considerations

### Using the "Attach" Feature of SQLite to Connect to Private Database

A data source of the SQLite plugin specifies a specific SQLite location.
But by using the [attach feature](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_attach.html) this restriction can be circumvented.

A **user with read only permissions** on the database can use the attach feature in a query to connect to any database that the Grafana user has access to on the system.

Recommendations to mitigate risks:

- Set the "AttachLimit" (a configuration of the SQLite data source) to 0, to disable this option.

### Access to The Grafana Internal SQLite Database

Grafana itself can run with an SQLite database as a data storage.
Using this plugin this file can be accessed.

There are no built-in restrictions preventing a **user with permissions to edit the data source configuration** from attaching to the SQLite database and accessing its contents.

This means that sensitive data, including secrets stored within the database, could potentially be exposed if appropriate access controls are not enforced at the Grafana level.

Recommendations to mitigate risks:

- Use the "block_list" option in the grafana.ini ([see below for more information](#configuration)) to block access.
- Limit Data Source Editing Permissions: Restrict the ability to modify the data source configuration to only trusted administrators.
- Do not use SQLite as the data storage for Grafana but a database with more access controls (like Postgres).

## Support for Time Formatted Columns

SQLite has no native "time" format. It relies on strings and numbers for time and dates. Since
especially for time series Grafana expects an actual time type, however, the plugin provides a way
to infer a real timestamp. This can be set in the query editor by providing the name of the column,
which should be reformatted to a timestamp.

The plugin supports two different inputs that can be converted to a "time" depending on the type
of the value in the column, that should be formatted as "time":

1. **A number input**: It is assumed to be a unix timestamp / unix epoch. This represents time in
   the number of **seconds** (make sure your timestamp is not in milliseconds). More information is
   here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>

2. **A string input**: The value is expected to be formatted in accordance with **RFC3339**,
   e.g. `"2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"`. Edge cases might occur and the parsing library used is the
   source of truth here: <https://golang.org/pkg/time/#pkg-constants>.

Timestamps stored as unix epoch should work out of the box, but the string formatting might require
adjusting your current format. The below example shows how to convert a "date" column to a parsable
timestamp:

```SQL
WITH converted AS (
   -- a row looks like this (value, date): 1.45, '2020-12-12'
   SELECT value,  date || 'T00:00:00Z' AS datetime FROM raw_table
)
SELECT datetime, value FROM converted ORDER BY datetime ASC
```

## Macros

This plugins supports macros inspired by the built-in Grafana data sources (e.g.
<https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/postgres/#macros>).

However, as each macro needs to be re-implemented from scratch, only the following macros are
supported. Other macros (that you might expect from other SQL databases) are not supported by the
plugin (yet).

### $__unixEpochGroupSeconds(unixEpochColumnName, intervalInSeconds)

Example: `$__unixEpochGroupSeconds("time", 10)`

Will be replaced by an expression usable in GROUP BY clause. For example:
`cast(("time" / 10) as int) * 10`

### $__unixEpochGroupSeconds(unixEpochColumnName, intervalInSeconds, NULL)

Example: `$__unixEpochGroupSeconds(timestamp, 10, NULL)`

This is the same as the above example but with a fill parameter so missing points in that series
will be added for Grafana and `NULL` will be used as value.

In case multiple time columns are provided the first one is chosen as the column to determine the
gap filling. "First" in this context means first in the SELECT statement. This column needs to have
no NULL values and must be sorted in ascending order.

## Alerting

The plugins supports the Grafana alerting feature. Similar to the built in data sources alerting
does not support variables as they are normally replaced in the frontend, which is not involved
for the alerts. In order to allow time filtering this plugin supports the variables `$__from` and
`$__to`. For more information about those variables see here:
<https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/variable-types/global-variables/#__from-and-__to>.
Formatting of those variables (e.g. `${__from:date:iso}`) is not supported for alerts, however.

## Configuration

Most of the plugin configuration happens when adding a datasource via the Grafana frontend.
All such configuration can also be provisioned ([see the FAQ for more details](https://github.com/fr-ser/grafana-sqlite-datasource/blob/main/docs/faq.md#can-i-use-provisioning-with-this-plugin)).

Aside from that, the plugin supports the following configuration via the `grafana.ini` file.
The following block shows the default values and gives an explanation of each field.

```ini
[plugin.frser-sqlite-datasource]
   ; this is a comma separated list of strings that the whole path of the SQLite database cannot contain.
   ; use this to prevent access (even from Grafana admin users) from certain files or paths
   ;block_list = "grafana.db,private_folder,other.db"
   block_list = ""
```
