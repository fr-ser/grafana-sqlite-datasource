## [2.0.2]

This release adds testing against Grafana v8.1.0 and fixes an issue with query variables.

## [2.0.1]

This release fixes some long standing issues that prevented the right use of the alerting feature
of the plugin even though it was enabled already.

### Fixed

- Using the `$__from` and `$__to` variables for alerting
- Fixing a caching bug for the query (for alerting)

## [2.0.0]

All current Raspberry Pi Zero and 1 models have an ARMv6 architecture.
All other models (2 Mod. B v1.2, 3 and 4) have an 64Bit ARMv8 architecture.
As only the Raspberry Pi 2 Mod. B has an ARMv7 architecture this is not used as default anymore.
The Raspberry Pi 2 Mod. B will require a manual installation and all others will be handled
via the Grafana CLI.

### Changed

- Using ARMv6 instead of ARMv7 as 32Bit ARM default

## [1.2.1]

### Added

- More debug level logging from the plugin

### Fixed

- The type inference of columns in the backend is now ignoring the letter casing

## [1.2.0]

### Added

- The response of the plugin includes the final query as metadata and can be checked in the
  inspector now
- Macro `unixEpochGroupSeconds`:
  - replace time columns with an expression to group by
  - Allow filling up missing values with `NULL`

### Fixed

- return additional time formatted column for time-series formats as normal values (previously
  they were skipped)

## [1.1.0]

## [1.0.3]

### Fixed

- Showing better error messages for certain fail conditions of the plugin health check (e.g.

## [0.2.3]
